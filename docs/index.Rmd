## Why Resale Flat Prices?

* In Singapore, HDB flats are home to over 80% of its resident population.
* This application provides a means to explore the official transaction data,
* ... and provide a simple price estimation for a given flat type by towns.
* Historical data price data available at, https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices.

---

## The Prediction Model

* Linear regression model considering  *flat type*, *town*, *floor area*
and the *age of the flat*.
* Example resale flat price estimation: 

```{r}
source("../resale.R")
x <- data.frame(flat_type=c("4 ROOM"), town=c("TAMPINES"),
                floor_area_sqm=c(sample(70:130, 1)), age_year=c(10))
print(x)
predict(ddp.lm0, x)
```

## How Does it Work?

## Remarks / Future Works 

* Take it with a grain of salt. Many factors not accounted for.
* No checks for invalid combination of flat type / floor area yet.
* Yet to build automatic data source update detection & refresh. 
* The full source code is available at, https://github.com/cifr/resale
